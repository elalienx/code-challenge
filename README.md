# Mevisio Code Challenge

## Editors note

Hi it was very fun to work on this project. Some notes on the frontend:

- Although it seems an overkill to make a component for each input type, when they are only use once for each type in the whole app, this would allow us to make UI tests using Testing Library üêô
- Same with the data parsing methods `countReferences()`, `filterByMinimumValue()`, and `formatReferences()` as this allows to test them using Jest.
- With more time, I would have stylized the input checkbox and input range (slider). I have done on it on other projects but ran out of time.

## Project dependencies

- Added `node-fetch` to the backend as it was giving me an error of fetch is not defined. My theory is that I have a different version of Node installed in my machine than the one used to build the backend.
- Added `react-d3-cloud` to render the world cloud on the screen.
- Added `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` to display nice icons on the navbar and news feed.

## Frontend diagram

This is the frontend diagram/component tree with the props passed down. With more time, or actually on a bigger app we would use ContextAPI or Redux to pass the data down in combination of Router DOM for better page navigation.
